## DevOps & Agile
The difference is mainly the preoccupations. Agile and devops have different preoccupations but they are helping each other. Agile want short iteration, which is only possible with the automation that Devops brings. Agile want customer to try a specific version and quickly give feedback which is only possible if devops make creation of new environment easy.
