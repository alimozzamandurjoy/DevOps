Hello,
I am making this repo so that I can keep track on my learning and keep the notes in it. This repo is started from 18th April,2022. I am hoping to give 90-100 days in DevOps sector.


I'm taking help from  

 1. [DevOps Beginners to Advanced | Decoding DevOps with Projects](https://udemy.com/course/decodingdevops)
 2. [90 days of DevOps by Michael Cade  ](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps)

 let's se how it goes.
